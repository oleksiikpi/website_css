    <h2>Ancient times</h2>
    <p>People began to settle on both banks of the Psel River long ago. The remains of burials dating back to the first millennium BC were found near the village of Timiriazivka (southwestern suburb). As early as the II-VI centuries AD, Slavic tribes lived here; traces of their settlements and burial grounds were found in the southwestern part of the city, on Pavlova and Kruhova streets.</p>
    <p>In the VIII-X centuries, there was a settlement of northerners on the territory of the former village of Topoli (now Topolianska Street in Sumy). The remains of a large settlement from the times of Kyivan Rus, which some historians associate with the ancient Russian city of Lipetsk, have been preserved on Luke. In the area of the village of Zelenyi Hai - Zhytheiske, there is a large Berlytsia settlement with the remains of a settlement of the IX-XI centuries, about 14 mound groups of burials, and the remains of burials of the Scythian period.</p>
    <p>According to one of the hypotheses, the Berlytsia settlement corresponds to the chronicle town of Biryn, as evidenced by the existence of the Biryn parish for several centuries. In the central part of Sumy, the remains of an ancient Russian settlement of the XI century were discovered, on the basis of which (probably under the same name) Sumy city was restored in 1652.</p>

    <h2>The history of the name:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1652:</strong> When the settlement was founded, it was called Sumyn Sloboda.</li>
        <li><strong>1656:</strong> After becoming a city, the name was changed to Sumyn.</li>
        <li><strong>1650–1660:</strong> The name evolved to its current form, Sumy, when the letter “n” gradually disappeared.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Versions of the origin of the name</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Origin from rivers:</strong> Most likely, the name is related to the local Sumy (now Sumka) and Sumka (now Strelka) rivers. This option is considered to be the most reasonable, as it is a common practice to name settlements after rivers.</li>
        <li><strong>The legend of the bags of gold:</strong> The city's coat of arms and flag contain images of three bags.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional interpretation:</strong> Some researchers link the name to the verb “to grieve”. This could reflect the feelings of the migrants who left their native lands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <p>The official symbols of the city include the coat of arms, flag, and anthem.</p>
    <p><strong>The coat of Sumy</strong></p>

    <p>The coat of arms of Sumy was designed by Heraldmaster M. Shcherbatov in 1776 and approved on September 21, 1781, and restored on February 15, 1991 by the decision of the IV session of the Sumy City Council.</p>

    <p><strong>The anthem of Sumy</strong></p>
    <p>The anthem of Sumy was approved on June 23, 2004. The text was written by Mykola Hrytsenko and the music was composed by Valerii Kozupytsia.</p>

    <h2>History of Sumy</h2>
    <p>The history of the city begins with the aftermath of the Battle of Berestechko in 1651, where Ukrainian Cossacks led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky were defeated. After that, Khmelnytsky called on immigrants from the right-bank lands to move to Poltava and the borderlands, which are now known as Slobozhanshchyna. Between 1651 and 1660, a significant number of new settlements appeared on these lands, including Sumy, Kharkiv, Trostianets, Lebedyn, and others.</p>
    <p>On July 25, 1655, a tsarist decree allowed 100 families of peasants and Cossacks from the town of Stavyshche in the Kyiv region to settle in Sumy. According to one version, Gerasym Kondratiev arrived in Sumy with this group. Some historians consider this to be the date of the city's foundation.</p>
    <p>On July 1, 1656, Sumy Sloboda was reorganized into the city of Sumy, where the construction of the fortress began, which lasted until 1658 under the leadership of Moscow voivode Kyrylo Arseniev. The fortress was of strategic importance for defense against Tatar attacks. Its walls were built of oak logs, and an underground passage to the Psel River provided the city with water during the siege. The natural barriers were the rivers Psyol, Sumy, and Sumka, as well as an earthen rampart and a moat.</p>
    <p>In 1658, Sumy became the center of the Sloboda Cossack regiment, led by Gerasym Kondratiev. The city developed rapidly due to its favorable location on the trade route through Putivl to Moscow.</p>

    <p>By 1678, the town with its seat occupied a territory surrounded by a 7.4 km long wall and a 7.56 km long moat. The fortress had 27 towers, of which 4 had gates and the rest were blank.</p>
    <p>In 1702, the construction of the Resurrection Church, which is the oldest building in the city, was completed. During the Great Northern War (1708-1709), Peter the Great visited Sumy, holding military meetings and signing decrees that influenced the course of the war.</p>
    <p>According to the census of 1732, the Sumy regiment had 42,931 men, most of whom were Cossacks, auxiliaries, and subjects. The population of Sumy was almost entirely Ukrainian. The city was home to 3,818 men, including Cossacks, auxiliaries, clergy, and craftsmen.</p>
    <p>After the liquidation of the Sloboda autonomy in 1765-1780, Sumy became the center of the Sumy province, and from 1780 it became a county town of the Kharkiv province.</p>

    <p>Sumy, 1787 year.</p>
    <p>In the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the city developed rapidly due to the growth of industry: sugar, machine-building, textile, and metalworking industries, as well as trade. In 1877, Sumy had 153 stone houses and over 1800 wooden houses, and the population was 15,534. The city had gymnasiums, schools, a railway station, craft workshops, and 14 factories.</p>

    <h2>The Soviet-Ukrainian War</h2>
    <p>During the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917, the Ukrainian Central Rada sought autonomy for Ukraine within Russia and claimed all lands with a Ukrainian population, including Sumy. The Provisional Government, however, did not recognize these claims. With the proclamation of the Ukrainian People's Republic on March 6, 1918, Sumy became the zemstvo center of Slobozhanshchyna, according to the administrative division of the time. During the First Soviet-Ukrainian War, the Bolsheviks captured the city, but on April 1, 1918, Ukrainian troops, supported by Germany, regained control of Sumy.</p>
    <p>After Pavlo Skoropadskyi came to power and the formation of the Ukrainian state, Sumy became part of the Kharkiv province. In early 1919, Bolshevik troops occupied the city for the second time under the pretext of supporting the uprisings against the Hetman.</p>

    <h2>Soviet occupation of Ukraine</h2>
    <p>After the establishment of Soviet rule, the Sumy district was liquidated. In 1923-1930, Sumy was a district town, and in 1939 it became a regional center. In the 1930s, industry, educational and cultural institutions developed: a pedagogical institute, a local history museum, and a theater.</p>
    <p>Among the key events:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1961 — Sumy Bakery Plant was established.</li>
        <li>1966–1971 — construction of the Avangard stadium.</li>
        <li>1987 — Sumy worsted and spinning mill is put into operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In independent Ukraine</h2>
    <p>A new stage in the history of Sumy began in 1991. An important event was the “Student Revolution on the Grass” in 2004, which became an act of struggle for human rights and a harbinger of the Orange Revolution.</p>
    <p>In 2001, the Yubileiny Stadium was opened with a capacity of 25,830 spectators. It was used as a home arena not only by local teams, but also, for example, by Donetsk's Olimpik in 2016 due to the war in Donbas.</p>
    <p>On September 15, 2015, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the expansion of Sumy's territory to 9,538.58 hectares at the expense of the lands of adjacent village councils.</p>

    <h2>Russian-Ukrainian war</h2>
    <h3>The Battle of Sumy (2022)</h3>
    <p>On February 24, 2022, the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian troops approached Sumy from the northeast through the village of Yunakivka. At around 7:00 am, the battle for the city began. In the afternoon, at 13:35, a column of Russian vehicles with red ribbons was spotted near the village of Bezdryk, and an active battle began from the direction of Bilopilsky Road.</p>
    <p>At 16:36, fighting broke out near the cadet corps and a military unit on Kondratyeva Street, and at 17:00, Russian vehicles began moving through the town. Despite this, Ukrainian administrative buildings remained under the control of the Armed Forces. By the evening, Russian troops had gained a foothold in the Sumy district, positioning themselves in fields and forested areas near Kosivshchyna, Tokariv, and Nyzhnya Syrovatka.</p>
    <p>Late in the evening, around 22:00, a second battle broke out near the Cadet Corps boarding school with enhanced military and physical training. The fighting lasted until 1:30 am on February 25, setting fire to the checkpoint, the lyceum and the church.</p>
    <p>Over the next few days, street fighting continued in Sumy, enemy vehicles tried to break through the city, and the region's villages were constantly shelled. In the evening of February 24, the head of the Sumy Regional State Administration, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, appealed for help, noting that the region was protected only by territorial defense.</p>
    <p>On March 4, 80% of the city's power supply was restored, although some infrastructure, including the 40th power substation, remained destroyed. On the same day, the Office of the President of Ukraine published a list of destinations for humanitarian corridors, including Sumy, Shostka, Romny, Konotop, and Okhtyrka.</p>
    <p>On March 6, the First Sumy Humanitarian Headquarters was established to coordinate volunteer assistance in the region.</p>
    <p>After more than a month of fighting and shelling, Russian troops failed to achieve success in the Sumy region and left the area. On April 21, 2022, Ukrzaliznytsia resumed running electric trains in the region.</p>
    <p>On June 2, 2023, Russian propagandist Sergei Mikheev said that the Ukrainian border areas, including the city of Sumy, should be turned into a “dead zone,” calling for the total destruction of infrastructure and population.</p>
    <p>On October 31, 2023, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy established the Sumy City Military Administration to coordinate the defense of the city and the region.</p>
